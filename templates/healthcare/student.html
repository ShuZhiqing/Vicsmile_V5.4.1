            If you are an international student you may be entitled to public dental care in Victoria.
            <br>
            Australia has agreements with several countries regarding public health service that allows
            international students in Australia to access public health service through<a href="{% url 'medicare' %}" target="_parent"> Medicare</a>.
            Find out if your country of origin has a <a href="{% url 'agreement' %}" target="_parent">mutual health agreement</a> with Australia.

            <br>
            If you are eligible for<a href="{% url 'medicare' %}" target="_parent"> Medicare</a> you are entitled to public dental care in Victoria.
            Look up the hyperlinks for advantage and benefit you can claim from the government.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, if you are not entitled for Medicare you cannot use public dental care services.
            Nevertheless, as required by law, you must have a <a href="{% url 'insurance' %}" target="_parent"> private insurance </a>coverage.
            Check with your OSHC provider whether you are covered for dental care or not.
            <br>
            <br>
            Your local community dental clinic may sometimes cannot provide you the required service.
            In this situation, you may be given a voucher so that you can receive treatment from a private dentist that is valid for one to three months.
            <br>
            <br>
            Call or visit the nearest<a href="{% url 'home' %}#tm-section-1" target="_parent"> dental clinic </a>to you for question and appointment. If you do not speak English language very well,
            <a href="{% url 'language' %}" target="_parent"> Translation and Interpreting Service</a> may be useful for you.
